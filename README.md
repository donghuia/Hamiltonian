# Hamiltonian
This repository includes the proof process of the fault-tolerant Hamiltonian property of $D_{n,2}$ï¼Œas well as computer programs for constructing Hamiltonian paths and loops in $D_{n,k}$.
1. Ham-path-in-D22.py
   The program for constructing Hamiltonian paths between any two distinct nodes in $D_{2,2}$.
2. Ham-path-in-D22-with-faulty.py
   The program for constructing Hamiltonian paths between any two fault-free distinct nodes in $D_{2,2}$, where the faulty element set $|F|\leq nk-3$.
3. Ham-cycle-in-D22-with-faulty.py
   The program for constructing Hamiltonian cycles in $D_{2,2}$ is as follows, where the faulty element set $|F|\leq nk-2$.
4. The Fault-Tolerant Hamiltonian Properties of $D_{n,2}$.pdf
   The proof process of the fault-tolerant Hamiltonian property of $D_{n,2}$.
